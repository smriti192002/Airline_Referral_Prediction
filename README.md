## üìù Problem Statement <p id="bquestions"></p>

The goal of this project is to utilize passenger data from 2006 to 2019 to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a passenger recommending an airline to their friends. By understanding the factors that contribute to customer satisfaction and loyalty, we aim to identify opportunities for improving the customer experience and increasing word-of-mouth marketing for the airline. The data for this study includes responses from a variety of popular airlines, collected through scraping methods in the spring of 2019. This information will be used to train and evaluate the performance of our recommendation prediction model.
